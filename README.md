# C/C++, part II

This repository hosts the solutions for the second part of the C/C++ series of courses. I use CMake (**C**ross-platform **Make**); see https://cmake.org/ for the project description. This is obviously not required!

I use the JetBrains CLion IDE; do make sure to add your IDE-specific files to this project's `.gitignore` file.

For the stuff we hand in, I suggest we maintain a Latex document, since that makes linking code that much easier. I've already taken the liberty to add a basic folder structure to this project, and I think it is sensible to follow this: i.e., per week, a structure that contains at least,

```
week_*/
    text/
        week_*.tex
        week_*.pdf
    ex*/
        Misc. C++ files
    ex*/
        Misc. C++ files
    Etc. for the other exercises.
```

I personally use XeLatex to compile my documents, since it works much better with different font settings than does the default PDFLatex compiler.
