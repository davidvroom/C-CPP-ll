\textbf{Exercise 63}\\
The idea of this exercise is to recognize situations where copy elision may be active. We have created a small class Demo that provides the constructor, destructor, copy and move constructor and overloaded copy and move assignment operators.
With a main function we have created situations where copy elision, the move constructor, the copy assignment and/or the move assignment is used.
